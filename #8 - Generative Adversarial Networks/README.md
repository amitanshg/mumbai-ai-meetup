# #8 - Generative Adversarial Networks

Hey all, 

We are ready with the 8th session of our [Mumbai AI Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/mumbai-ai-meetup/) on 19th Aug at Kindle room. This time we will take you through the one of the most talked about topics this year - [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (fondly called as GANs). And we couldnâ€™t think of better speaker who are well versed in this domain - [Girish Patil](https://in.linkedin.com/in/girish-cloud) from [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Abstract of the Session:

Generative Adversarial Networks were introduced by [Ian Goodfellow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-goodfellow-b7187213) in 2014, and since then lot of interesting work has been done over the basic framework introduced. GANs try to generate data (images, music, text) from a predefined distribution and some conditions, so that one cannot differentiate whether the generated data point is synthetic or natural.

In this talk, we will take you through what GANs are, the mathematical intuition behind this idea, developments done in last two years and why it has been such a rage this year. We will look into some interesting real life applications of GANs such as [predicting the next frame in a video](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06380), [increasing resolution of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), [interactive image generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03552v2) etc.
