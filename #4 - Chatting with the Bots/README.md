# #4 - Chatting with the Bots

Date : 18th March, 2017

## Summary

Conversation is an integral part of human life and chatbots were the among the first tried things when AI was born as a field. [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) was one of the first chatbots that became famous around the same time.

This time, we have invited [Krupal Modi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krupal-modi-a5946b32), Head of the ML team at [Haptik Inc.](http://haptik.ai/) Haptik is a personal assistant service, aims to redefine the way people get their everyday tasks done using chatbots as the underlying interface. Krupal will talk about “How to choose algorithms while building chatbots?” based on various features and distribution of text datasets. He will share his experience as to how ML algorithms at Haptik have evolved and will also discuss the challenges they face today.

Additionally, we will also have a short session by [Cuddle.ai](http://www.cuddle.ai/), where we will discuss about “Code mixing and code borrowing - building next-gen personalised chatbots”.
