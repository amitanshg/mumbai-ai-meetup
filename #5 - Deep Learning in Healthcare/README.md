# #5 - Deep Learning in Healthcare

Date : 22nd April, 2017

## Brief

With medical imaging data growing exponentially every day, the rate of growth of number of radiologists is extremely low. Deep learning is enabling radiologists to cover this chasm by enabling them to make faster and efficient diagnosis. However, there are many challenges that needs to be addressed before this technology becomes an integral part of the medical industry. Shubham Jain and Ankit Modi will briefly take us though the challenges Qure.ai faces when building any deep learning solution for medical image diagnosis.

Additionally, we are also having a Virtual Reality demo booth setup where you will get to experience Qure.ai

About Qure.ai:
Qure.ai believes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the key in ensuring that healthcare practitioners can focus on cases that truly matter, letting machines diagnose or treat the easier ones. Their aim is to leverage deep learning effectively to diagnose disease from radiology and pathology imaging, and create personalized cancer treatment plans from psychopathology imaging and genome sequences.
