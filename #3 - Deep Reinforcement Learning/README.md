# #3 - Deep Reinforcement Learning

Date : 18th Feb, 2017

## Speaker

This time we are going into deeper aspects of Artificial Intelligence, specifically the game changer technology of 2016 – Deep Reinforcement Learning. And we couldn’t think of a better speaker than [Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/), IIT Bombay. He is Among AI’s 10 to Watch, list published by IEEE Intelligent Systems, has been [RoboCup](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/sim/3dsimulation/) World Champions multiple times, one of the primary authors of [AI100](https://ai100.stanford.edu/people) (One Hundred Year Study on AI) report 2015, and recipients of many such accolades.

## Abstract

If an agent can sense, think, and act in an unknown environment, how MUST it act? Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a general paradigm under which an agent, by trial and error, can discover actions that result in long-term gain.

However, RL is still counted upon as a practically viable technology. It is precisely this gap that deep learning is beginning to fill. The combination of RL with deep learning has registered remarkable successes in recent months. Notably, it has resulted in AI-based agents that exceed human-level performance on a suite of ATARI console games, and also on the more challenging game of Go.

Shivaram will begin this talk with an overview of RL and its key algorithmic elements. Specifically, he will outline the role of representations in determining the success of RL. This will be followed by a brief survey of deep learning, and proceed to describe the architecture of the agents that have recently succeeded at ATARI and Go. The talk will be concluded with thoughts about the new beginning for ``deep reinforcement learning`` followed by a Q&A session.
