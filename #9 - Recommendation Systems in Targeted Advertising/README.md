# #9 - Recommendation Systems in Targeted Advertising

Hey Everyone,

For our Meetup this time we are going to try something different- a brains-on session (yes, not hands-on..). As the theme suggests over here we will attempt solving a real-world problem involving one of the fastest growing crowdfunding platform [Ketto.org](https://www.ketto.org/). For Ketto, one of their biggest problems is how to get their advertisements to show up in front of the right audience. To elaborate, the objective of Ketto’s campaign is to identify and engage with audiences who will support their cause and they, in turn, recommend that cause to their network on different social channels. So in this Meetup, we will all brainstorm to create a solution for Ketto using Recommendation Systems which will improve the accuracy of their campaign, thereby their ROI.

The session will be spearheaded by Zaheer Adenwala, CTO, Ketto.org and will be moderated by Parikshit Nag and Ekta Singh from Fractal Analytics team. Parkshit and Ekta will also quickly take us through how Recommendation Systems are built and some short case studies to get our thinking gears moving.
